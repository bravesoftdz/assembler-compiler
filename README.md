# 8-bit Assembler compiler
8-bit Assembler compiler is [NASM](http://www.nasm.us/) compatible assembler compiler to generate binaries for 8-bit x86 like CPUs.  The binaries produced with this compiler can execute on [Marco Schweighauser's 8-bit virtual Javascript CPU](https://www.mschweighauser.com/make-your-own-assembler-simulator-in-javascript-part1). 

This native compiler can build using Lazarus / FPC. During the implementation we build and test this compiler successfully on Linux and Windows operating systems.
